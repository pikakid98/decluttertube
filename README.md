## What even are these filters?

`30dollarstudiohaircut` DON'T YOU LECTURE ME WITH YOUR 30 DOLLAR HAIRCUT!! Removes pointless notifications from YouTube Studio

`CategorizeThis` Removes the categories from YouTube (This unfortunately also breaks the newest and oldest section on channels)

`NoThanks.IPreferVideos` Removes the Releases and Podcasts tab from YouTube Channels

`WhatDoAnyOfTheseDo` Removes all of the pointless buttons on videos like share, the (now pointless) dislike button etc.

`GiveEmAShot` Removes "Live" tag, Verification ticks and view counts, like counts and sub counts to encorage people to check out smaller creators without YouTube's brainwashing "High view count = good content" mentality

`IDontNeedNoHelp` Removes the help and feedback options from YouTube and YouTube Studio [[Known to cause issues] *3](https://github.com/pikakid98/decluttertube#3)

`NoDollarYT` Removes the join button and member badges (Doesn't affect live chat and chat replay due to how they work). Also removes fundraiser related content

`NoEmailLeak` Useful for livestreamers who are worried about clicking on something and accidentally leaking their email to the internet

`NoKappa` Hides livestream chat and chat replays for stream VODs and premieres

`NoShortsTitleSuggestions` Removes the hashtag suggestions from the title bar in YouTube Studio

`UnYousYourTube` Removes the "You" section on the left-hand sidebar

`HeartOfTheCards` Disables cards on the top right of the screen in videos

`NoLogo` Removes the YouTube logo from the website. If for whatever reason you want that

`DenerdPanel` Removes all debugging features from YouTube's right click menu [[Known to cause issues] *6](https://github.com/pikakid98/decluttertube#6)

`NoPanel` Removes the right click panel from the YouTube player. Loop controls now require an extra right click. Using this in conjunction with "DenerdPanel" is redundant [[Known to cause issues] *6](https://github.com/pikakid98/decluttertube#6)

`IOnlyWantComments` Removes the mentions tab from YouTube Studio

`NoHate` Removes the "Held For Review" tab in YouTube Studio

`NotAGamer` Removes the YouTube Gaming section on videos in the descriptions

`WhyDoesTheTimeStatusCoverTheThumbnail` Removes the time status (aka. How long the video is) from thumbnails to prevent covering important information

## Known issues
Please be aware that some of these filters may be broken or contain duplicate filters. I'll fix these as soon as I find them or they get reported

###### `*1`
This filter currently causes playlist features to go missing. I'm finding a way to fix this

###### `*2`
This filter acts differently on different channels for some reason, In some cases it hides Playlists and the About section. I'm currently trying to find a way around this

###### `*3`
Also removed the settings tab from the left-hand side bar (But there's another one in the account dropdown, So it isn't a problem)

###### `*4`
Causes cards on the top right to become unclickable  `Cause is currently unknown`

###### `*5`
This removes an entire row from the main page and POTENTIALLY other issues. But afaik, it isn't TOO bad. Additionally, I can't figure out how to JUST remove the mix as it seems to keep coming back at random. Another issue is removing a few recent videos from every YouTube channel.. UGH!! `Cause is currently unknown`

###### `*6`
Both deletes or removes options from the settings in the video player. It also removes any qualities under 480p as well as Playback Speed. Currently trying to find a way to fix this

###### `*7`
Causes the "Channels" section on channels to be hidden `Cause is currently unknown (However, this is potentially because Youtube is currently reworking their UI and only some accounts have gotten this update)`
